## üèüÔ∏è Racetrack Info-Screens and Functional Requirements
Beachside Racetrack is a local racetrack that requires a system to control races and inform spectators in real time. The system aims to reduce reliance on staff by automating race management and spectator information.

### üåä Situation Overview
Beachside Racetrack is located in a touristic area and has various facilities such as a reception area, paddock, and spectator seating. Due to high competition for hiring staff, the racetrack seeks to automate its operations as much as possible.

### üìã Functional Requirements
- **User Personas**
  - **Employee**: General term for anyone employed by the racetrack.
  - **Safety Official**: Responsible for starting races, ensuring safety, and monitoring hazards.
  - **Lap-line Observer**: Records when cars cross the lap line; role will be automated in the future.
  - **Flag Bearer**: Communicates safety instructions to drivers using flags; will be replaced by screens.
  - **Receptionist**: Welcomes guests and registers race drivers at the front desk.
  - **Guest**: Any person present at the racetrack.
  - **Race Driver**: Guest participating in a race.
  - **Spectator**: Guest watching a race.

- **Race Sessions**
  - Up to 8 drivers compete to achieve the fastest lap in a 10-minute race session.
  - The Safety Official starts the race and monitors safety.

- **Race Cars**
  - All cars are equal in performance and identified by a number.
  - The cars are tracked entities during the race, and driver performance is linked to the car.

- **Current Race Modes**
  - **üü¢ Safe**: No flag.
  - **üü° Hazard**: Yellow flag, drivers must drive slowly.
  - **üî¥ Danger**: Red flag, drivers must stop.
  - **üèÅ Finish**: Chequered flag, drivers proceed to the pit lane.

### üìñ User Stories and Desired Processes
- **Configure Upcoming Races**: Receptionist configures race sessions, including adding/removing drivers and race sessions.
- **Announce Next Race**: Drivers are automatically assigned cars and informed when it's their turn.
- **Start Race**: Safety Official starts the race using an interface, updating the race mode and leaderboard.
- **Control Race Modes**: Safety Official can change race modes using an interface, with screens replacing flag bearers.
- **Finish Race and End Session**: Race ends automatically or manually, and cars return to the pit lane.
- **Record Lap Times**: Lap-line Observer uses a tablet to record lap times by pressing buttons representing each car.
- **Spectator View**: Spectators can view leaderboards with real-time lap times, current laps, and race status.

### üîê Security Requirements
- Employee interfaces must be protected with access keys defined as environment variables.
- Each interface (Front Desk, Race Control, Lap-line Tracker) requires its own access key.
- Incorrect access key attempts result in a delay before prompting again.

### üíª Technology Requirements
- **Backend**: Node.js server using Socket.io for real-time functionality.
- **Frontend**: Interfaces accessible via first-level routes for each user type (e.g., `/leader-board`, `/next-race`).
- **Real-Time Communication**: All displays and interfaces must update in real time without polling.

### üìö Additional Requirements
- **Documentation**: A README.md file explaining how to start the server and use the system, including setting environment variables.
- **Persistence**: The MVP does not require data persistence, but future versions could implement persistent storage.
